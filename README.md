xbmc-command
============

A simple terminal Kodi/XBMC command client. Connects to the
Kodi/XBMC Mediacenter via TCP and sends JSON-RPC requests. The client is not
interactive and can only run one command per execution.

It can handle tasks like 'volume up' or 'play youtube video'.
See the help for all available commands.

You can also send arbitrary JSON RPCs and use this program in your own scripts

    xbmc-command rpc XBMC.GetInfoLabels '{"labels": ["MusicPlayer.Artist"]}' --id test

You have to **enable** the JSON-RPC API within Kodi:
http://kodi.wiki/view/JSON-RPC_API#Enabling_JSON-RPC

Installation
------------

run `# python setup.py install` in the root directory of this repository.

Arch Linux users can use the PKGBUILD-git file to create a package.

    $ wget https://raw.github.com/mychris/xbmc-command/master/PKGBUILD-git
    $ makepkg -p PKGBUILD-git

If you want to use plyr, the lib must be installed (no runtime error if the
module is not found). See Optional Dependencies.

A **configuration file** can be used to specify the host, port or timeout.
It should be installed in `ROOT/usr/share/doc/xbmc-command/xbmc-command.cfg`.
Just copy it to `~/.config/xbmc-command.cfg` and set the preferences.

Usage
-----

**help**

    $ xbmc-command --help
    usage: xbmc-command [--host <host>] [--port <port>] [--timeout <sec>] [--help]
                        [--version]
                        <command> ...

    Connects to the XBMC Mediacenter at <host>:<port> via TCP
    and executes the specified command.

    If --host, --port or --timeout is not present and the config
    file ~/.config/xbmc-command.cfg is readable, the values
    specified in this file will be used.

    Optional arguments:
      --host <host>     connect to server at host <host>
      --port <port>     connect to server at port <port>
      --timeout <sec>   wait <sec> till timeout, default 5
      --help            show this help message and exit
      --version         output version information and exit

    See 'xbmc-command <command> --help' for more information
    on a specific command.

**config**

The config file must be stored in `~/.config/xbmc-command.cfg`.
It consists of the sections *XBMC* and *alias*.

The *XBMC* section may contain the options 'host', 'port' and 'timeout'.
See the help.

The *alias* section contains command aliases. The alias must not be quoted, but
may contain quoted strings as arguments. If a line is indented by one or more
spaces, the line belongs to the previous defined alias.

    y = youtube --quality 1080p

    shutdown = system shutdown

Dependencies
------------

* Python2.7
* Kodi (XBMC) 14.0 "Helix" (might work with older versions too) <http://kodi.tv/>

Optional Dependencies
---------------------

* plyr: Retrieve lyrics with plyr (<https://github.com/sahib/python-glyr>)
  
  if plyr is not properly installed (or not installed at all) xbmc-command will
  not use this library.

Note
----

I use xbmc-command on a daily base. Updates don't come very frequently because
it works for me. If you have any issues or want some feature, create an issue
and let me know (or fork and send a pull request).
